Reclining at the end of a day, spend a few minutes meditating while
lying on one side. Keep the body quite straight and bend one arm up so
that the hand acts as a support for the head. Sweep through the body,
resting its stresses; or collect your attention on the breath,
consciously putting aside memories of the day just past and expectations
of tomorrow. In a few minutes, with your mind clear, you'll be able to
rest well.
