Meditating with a few friends at regular times can be a great support
towards constancy of practice and development of wisdom. The solitary
meditator eventually faces diminishing willpower, as there's often
something else to do that seems more important (or more interesting)
than watching the breath. Regular group meditation for an agreed-upon
duration keeps the participants going, regardless of their flux of
moods. (The investigation of these shifts of disposition often yields
important insights, but on our own we can find it difficult to persevere
with them.) As well as seeing the personal benefits, you can reflect
that your efforts are helping others to keep practicing.
